# CustomerSegmentation
Customer Segmentation using BIRCH Clustering Algorithm

This project is about clustering of mall customers based on various attributes such as their age, annual income and spending score. The project consists of data wrangling and data visualization. On top of that, the clustering algorithm used in this project is Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH). This algorithm is well known for its ability to perform on large datasets. At the end, the performance of clustering is evaluated using silhouette scores.
